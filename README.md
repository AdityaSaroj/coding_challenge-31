# What is Hacktoberfest?
Every October, Digital Ocean runs Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open-sourced software. Encouraging developers at all stages in their careers to participate in the open-source community. The event is open to everyone in the global community, no matter your skill level or background and it grows in size every year. 

Hacktoberfest 2020 returns to ZTM with three brand new projects for you to complete the challenge and **earn a limited edition T-shirt!** All you have to do to take part is:

- Sign up on the [Official Hacktoberfest Website](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)  
- Make 4 pull requests to **ANY** public repository during the month of October!
- Have fun

This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a free T-shirt and some stickers.
You can find out more details about Hacktoberfest on their website, as well as track your progress throughout the month.
